/**
 * conflictWork — turning a merge conflict into work somebody actually picks up.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-30, task 86bbq0fh8). When the merge step hit a real
 * conflict it did two things: it commented on the ticket telling Dane his
 * approval still stood and he need not act, and it posted `MERGE BLOCKED` to
 * the bus asking for an agent session to resolve the conflict and push.
 *
 * Nothing consumes bus messages. No session polls that channel and turns "a
 * session needs to resolve this" into claimed work, so the request went into
 * an empty room while the ticket comment beside it described a process already
 * underway. Ticket 86bbmfc15 (PR #434) sat that way from 2026-08-26 to
 * 2026-08-29. Dane found it himself and asked why nothing had happened. Every
 * relay pass in those three days logged `MERGE HANDED OFF (unchanged, nothing
 * posted)` and `0 merged` — the correct quiet behaviour once a hand-off
 * exists. The system worked as designed and the design had a hole.
 *
 * Dane picked option C on 2026-08-30: **file it into the Loop Queue.** On a
 * conflict the merge step files an ordinary `Queued` ticket — "resolve the
 * conflict on branch X for ticket Y" — into the same list the build loop
 * already drains every pass. No new consumer, because the consumer exists and
 * is already running on a timer. He is not interrupted, and the work is
 * visible on the board like everything else.
 *
 * Two rules this module exists to keep (vault `doctrine/TERMINOLOGY.md`,
 * ratified 2026-08-29):
 *
 *   - A hand-off names which of the two it needs — a person (a human being)
 *     or an agent session. A hand-off that cannot name a specific waiting
 *     actor does not get to imply one. Passive voice is the tell, and is
 *     itself the defect.
 *   - If nothing is going to pick the work up, the message says so.
 *
 * So `filed` is not decoration here. It is the named actor, and the notice
 * builder in mergeOnComment.js reads it to decide which promise the body is
 * allowed to make. No ticket filed means no actor, which means no promise.

 * The ONE shape a filed conflict ticket is recorded in, and the only shape

 * THE ONE PREDICATE (2026-08-31, task 86bbq80j5).
 *
 * `gate.action === 'conflict'` is GitHub's answer, and GitHub's answer about a
 * branch is often minutes stale. What THIS machine found when it tried the
 * merge itself is the `localVerdict`, and there are THREE answers it can
 * give — not two:
 *
 *   'real-conflict'   — the branches genuinely changed the same lines.
 *                       Somebody has to decide what the merged file says.
 *   'no-overlap'      — the local merge really did come back clean. A lost
 *                       push race, or GitHub answering about a state it has
 *                       not caught up with. Nothing to resolve; the next pass
 *                       retries and it clears itself.
 *   'could-not-check' — the check never ran. Wrong repo, failed fetch, no
 *                       scratch worktree, a merge result that failed its own
 *                       ancestor proof. NO FINDING WAS MADE.
 *
 * WHY THREE AND NOT TWO (review round 2, 2026-08-31). The first fix collapsed
 * the last two into one bucket called 'unknown' and then wrote copy for it
 * that asserted a finding. On a `FETCH_FAILED` verdict the ticket comment said
 * *"this machine could not check whether that is true"* while the bus post,
 * seconds later, said *"this machine found no overlap between the branch and
 * main. Nothing needs resolving and nobody needs to claim it."* One says it
 * could not look; the other stands the room down on the strength of a look it
 * never took — the same two-comments-200ms-apart shape this ticket exists to
 * remove, arriving in the one place Dane reads.
 *
 * It cost a second way too: `WRONG_REPO` is what the relay gets for EVERY
 * conflicting PR in a repo whose checkout is not on that machine — the queue
 * carries `repo:normie`, `repo:pulse` and `repo:vault`. Deterministically,
 * every pass, forever. Read as self-healing, that filed nothing and told the
 * room nobody needed to claim it, when in fact nothing had been checked and no
 * retry from that machine could ever succeed.
 *
 * So a finding is only ever claimed when a finding was actually made, and the
 * two decisions that matter — file a ticket? name which actor? — read ONE
 * function. They cannot drift, because there is only one answer to read.
 *
 * The original incident this predicate was written for is still the reason it
 * gates filing at all: on 2026-08-30 the merge step filed a resolution ticket
 * on `gate.action` alone, while the hand-off comment built moments later read
 * the verdict and correctly promised the next pass would merge it (PR #444,
 * ticket 86bbmmv7t). The filed ticket — "Resolve the merge conflict on PR
 * #444" — described clearing conflict markers that did not exist.
 * `git merge-tree` on that pair exited 0.

/**
 * THE ONE VOCABULARY (2026-08-31, task 86bbq80j5, review round 3).

 * The three-way answer above reached the hand-off comment and stopped there.
 * Four other surfaces still asked a TWO-way question — they branched on the
 * actor (`later-pass` or not), which cannot tell "this machine looked and
 * found an overlap" apart from "this machine never looked at all". So a
 * `WRONG_REPO` verdict produced a hand-off comment saying *"Whether there is
 * anything to resolve is still unknown"* directly above a link to a ticket
 * titled *"Resolve the merge conflict on PR #501"*, whose acceptance criteria
 * told its builder to clear conflict markers. That is the 2026-08-30 PR #444
 * defect word for word, reproduced one level down — and it is deterministic,
 * because `WRONG_REPO` is what the relay machine returns for EVERY conflicting
 * PR on a `repo:normie`, `repo:pulse` or `repo:vault` ticket, every pass.
 *
 * So the nouns live in ONE table, keyed by the one verdict kind. A surface
 * cannot describe a verdict as something the verdict did not say, because no
 * surface holds its own words any more. Adding a verdict kind without giving
 * it a full entry here fails a test.
 *
 * The `real-conflict` column is the wording that shipped before any of this,
 * kept byte-for-byte: review rounds 2 and 3 both verified those bodies against
 * `main` as evidence the fixes had not disturbed the case that was always
 * right. That is a property worth keeping rather than a coincidence to spend.

/**
 * Should this pass stay quiet about a hand-off it has already posted?
 *
 * The quiet path is the RIGHT behaviour — re-deriving the same answer every
 * pass says nothing new — and it is also exactly where the three days of
 * silence lived. So quiet is now conditional on there being a named actor and
 * on that actor being recent enough to still be plausible:
 *
 *   - no ticket filed          -> never quiet. Nothing is going to pick it up.
 *   - filed, under threshold   -> quiet. It is in the queue the loop drains.
 *   - filed, over threshold    -> not quiet. A day of no progress is news.
 *
 * `at` is the ISO timestamp off the merge marker the earlier pass wrote; an
 * unreadable or missing one counts as stalled, on the same fail-safe reasoning
 * as everywhere else here — "nobody is working on it" and "I cannot tell" look
 * identical, and only one of them is safe to sit on.
 *
 * `actor` (2026-08-31, task 86bbq80j5) is the notice's own answer to "who acts
 * next". It matters because `later-pass` is a NAMED, REAL actor with no ticket
 * behind it: the verdict said there is no overlap to resolve, so the next relay
 * pass retries the catch-up and it clears itself. Reading that as "no ticket,
 * therefore nobody" would nag the bus every ten minutes about a branch that is
 * healing on its own — the false-alarm class this ticket exists to remove. It
 * still stalls on AGE: a self-healing hand-off that has not healed in a day is
 * news, and the sentence says which of the two it is. Any other actor — and an
 * absent one — keeps the original filed-ticket rule, which fails toward noise.

 *
 * IT READS THE ACTOR, NOT `filed` (2026-08-31, task 86bbq80j5, review round 1).
 * Every other branch of the hand-off was converted to read the notice's actor;
 * this one was missed, and it is the branch that reaches the BUS. Before the
 * filing gate existed, `filed` was a safe stand-in for the actor here — a
 * conflict hand-off always had a ticket unless filing had actually failed, so
 * "NOT filed anywhere" was true whenever it printed. The gate created a second
 * way for `filed` to be null: the self-healing one, where the verdict found no
 * overlap and the actor is the next relay pass. Reaching this line down that
 * path produced one sentence naming two actors —
 *
 *     PR #444 has been waiting on a conflict resolution — NOT filed anywhere
 *     — no actor exists for it. no overlap was found, so every pass has been
 *     retrying the catch-up on its own — and it has not cleared in 25 hours.
 *
 * — which is the exact failure shape of the two comments 200ms apart that this
 * whole ticket exists to remove, arriving in the one place Dane actually
 * reads. `filed` still discriminates the other two actors; `later-pass` gets
 * its own clause, and it agrees with the `why` beside it.
