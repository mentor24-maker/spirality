 * ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING, AND THE MERGE-CAPABLE LIST GOES FIRST (2026-09-03,
 * task 86bbugakw). The relay spends one request per open ticket to read its
 * comments, and ClickUp allows ~100 per minute across the whole company's
 * token. Agent Response held 92 open tickets and is never drained, so with it
 * first the allowance was gone before the sweep reached the Loop Queue — the
 * only list carrying `merge: true`.
 *
 * The relay then failed every 10-minute pass for SIXTEEN HOURS: `requests this
 * pass: 97`, then `100`, then HTTP 429. Merge-on-comment was dead the whole
 * time (Dane commented `merge` on 86bbjt1b4 at 11:17am and nothing acted on
 * it), Lane A halted fail-safe on every pass, and with nothing merging the WIP
 * cap filled and the build loop declined every pass saying "the merge side is
 * the bottleneck". Open work went 38 -> 63 in seven days with every gate green.
 *
 * Reordering does not FIX the budget — the incremental scan (86bbugbay), the
 * 429 retry (86bbugbym) and the shared budget (86bbugcdb) do that. It makes the
 * failure land on the list that can afford it: a notify-only sweep that stops
 * short delays a bus message, where a merge sweep that stops short strands
 * shipped work behind an unread comment. Those are not the same cost, so when
 * the budget runs out it should run out on Agent Response.

 * `operatorCard.js` draws. That banner is therefore the one durable mark on a
 * ticket saying "the machine asked something here", which is what lets a later
 * pass order the trail: anything of Dane's AFTER the newest card is an answer
 * to it, and anything before it belonged to an earlier round.
 *
 * Matched on the label with its trailing space trimmed off, because the label
 * is drawn with one and a round trip through ClickUp is not guaranteed to keep
 * it. The `#` rule around it is deliberately NOT part of the test: ClickUp
 * escapes markdown punctuation on the way back out, so a rule can return as
 * `\#\#\#...` and a matcher reading it would fail on exactly the tickets it
 * was written for.
 *
 * THIS IS THE BANNER TEST AND NOTHING ELSE — authorship is a SEPARATE question
 * and the caller owes it (2026-09-07, round 1 review). The banner is just text,
 * so a comment of Dane's that QUOTES the card above his reply matched here, and
 * the quote is newer than the card it quotes. `answerAwaitingHandback` then
 * anchored the question on HIS OWN comment, found nothing of his after it, and
 * returned `none`: the relay handed nothing back — a regression against the old
 * fresh-only rule, which would have moved it — while `lib/staleAnswer.js` filed
 * the same ticket as healthy. Stranded, with the watchdog saying all-clear.
 *
 * So `answerAwaitingHandback` requires a card to be MACHINE-WRITTEN, through
 * the same `isMachine` predicate it filters his answers with. One predicate,
 * asked once, which makes the two sets disjoint by construction: a comment can
 * never be both the question and the answer to it.

 * IS AN ANSWER FROM DANE SITTING ON THIS TICKET WITH NOTHING HAVING MOVED?

 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-06, task 86bbvr4w3). The hand-back used to fire on
 * ONE trigger and one only: a comment relayed to the party line *during this
 * pass*. That trigger is not repeatable. Relaying writes a permanent dedup
 * marker, so every later pass reads the comment as already relayed, computes
 * `fresh = 0`, and hands nothing back — for ever.
 *
 * On 2026-09-06 the 09:46 pass relayed Dane's answer on 86bbv8nvy, ran out of
 * ClickUp request budget between the relay and the move, and reported the
 * failure honestly into a bus post that the same rate limit then skipped. The
 * ticket was stranded in `Needs your input` permanently: the only event that
 * could release it had already happened and could never happen again. He found
 * it himself three and a half hours later.
 *
 * So the trigger moves from "what happened in this pass" to "what is true of
 * the ticket" — state that is re-derivable on every later pass, which is the
 * whole of the fix. Two facts, both read off the trail:
 *
 *   1. The newest escalation card is the QUESTION. Dane's newest comment after
 *      it is the ANSWER. Nothing before the card can release the ticket,
 *      which is what stops an answer from an earlier round releasing a fresh
 *      escalation if a marker write is ever lost.
 *   2. That answer must have been DELIVERED — relayed to the party line, or
 *      receipted on the ticket. That gate is unchanged and not weakened: a
 *      ticket must never move on an answer nobody ever got. What changes is
 *      that "delivered" is now read from the durable marker as well as from
 *      this pass's own success.
 *
 * NO CARD MEANS NO ANSWER TO THE QUESTION — `no-question`, never `answered`.
 * A ticket parked by hand, or one whose card has fallen off the newest page of
 * comments, gives no way to tell an answer from something he said last week,
 * and handing such a ticket back on the strength of an old comment is a worse
 * failure than the one being fixed. The caller keeps the old fresh-only
 * behaviour there, and `lib/staleAnswer.js` reports it as CANNOT TELL.
 *
 * @param comments   the ticket's comments (one page is enough — the card and
 *                   the answer are both recent by construction)
 * @param operatorId Dane's ClickUp user id
 * @param isMachine  (text) => boolean, so a machine card under his token is
 *                   never mistaken for his word (see operatorComments)
 * @param delivered  optional (comment) => boolean. Omit it to ask only
 *                   "has he answered?", which is what the report needs.

 * WHERE an answered ticket GOES — read off the ticket, not off a flat map.

 * `handbackTarget` above answers "may this watch release this status at all,
 * and where does a ticket with nothing built behind it go" — that is the
 * doctrine checkpoint and the ordinary case, and neither changes here. What it
 * could not answer is where a ticket whose work is ALREADY BUILT goes, because
 * it reads nothing about the ticket: every answered `Needs your input` ticket
 * went to `Queued`, unconditionally.
 *
 * `Queued` is a status `loop-build` claims from. So on 2026-09-07 ticket
 * 86bbw4dch — merged as PR #650, its last step a SQL file for Dane to run —
 * was answered ("Success. No rows returned"), handed back to `Queued`, and sat
 * there as claimable work with its pull request already merged and its branch
 * already deleted. An operator session caught it in minutes. Unwatched, a build
 * pass claims it, `build-start` finds a PR trail for a branch GitHub deleted at
 * merge, and the pass is in undefined territory having already moved live work
 * to `Building`. The claim itself cannot catch this — it guards on status,
 * which is exactly what makes it atomic.
 *
 * The repo already held the same judgement in another voice:
 * `npm run clickup -- migrate-rework` exists to move tickets that are `Queued`
 * WITH AN OPEN PR into `Rework`, because a queued ticket with a branch behind it
 * is a ticket a build pass will misread. A merged PR is further along still and
 * was landing in the same wrong place.
 *
 * `pr` is this ticket's own `PR opened:` trail, already resolved by the caller:
 *
 *   null / undefined        no trail — nothing was ever built. `Queued`, as before.
 *   { state: 'MERGED' }     the work is live. `Live`, which is where the relay's
 *                           own merge path already puts a merged ticket — and by
 *                           that path's own rule (`mergeDestination`), so a
 *                           description whose "Next slice:" line names more
 *                           work goes to `Queued` instead. A multi-slice
 *                           ticket's last PR is always the previous slice's,
 *                           already merged, so without this any question asked

 *   { state: 'CLOSED' }     abandoned without merging; GitHub deleted the branch,
 *                           so there is nothing to continue. `Queued`, to rebuild.
 *   { state: '' , why }     the state could NOT be read. Act 'cannot-tell': the

 * The relay's cost is not the list fetch — that is one request per 100
 * tickets. It is the per-ticket comment read, and the reply read behind each
 * operator comment. With 104 open tickets on Agent Response a pass spent
 * 114-115 requests against ClickUp's ~100-per-minute allowance, so every pass
 * was rate-limited partway through and finished INCOMPLETE. An incomplete
 * pass cannot run Lane A (standing condition 4), so the auto-merge lane
 * halted 271 passes in a row and had never once merged. The starvation was
 * the cause; the refusal was correct.
 *
 * So: a ticket nobody has touched since the last completed pass cannot have a
 * new comment on it. Measured 2026-09-03 on task 86bbqpwfa — a task's
 * `date_updated` equals its newest comment's timestamp to the millisecond, so
 * recency is a sound proxy for "might have something to say".
 *
 * THE NON-GOAL THE TICKET ASKED US TO DECIDE, decided here and deliberately
 * NOT applied to every watch: a MERGE-CAPABLE watch reads every ticket in its
 * statuses regardless of recency. Three things there are re-decided from
 * scratch on every pass and would break if a quiet ticket went unread:
 *
 *   1. A refused merge command is re-decided every pass (task 86bbjt18r) — a
 *      refusal is a snapshot of a moment, not a verdict. PR #558 sat refused
 *      for exactly this reason on 2026-09-03: CI had not finished inside the
 *      merge step's wait. The ticket then goes quiet, and a recency filter
 *      would mean the retry that was promised never happens.
 *   2. Lane A's candidates are Ready-to-launch tickets that must be announced,
 *      left an hour and then merged. Going quiet for an hour is the NORMAL
 *      path through that lane, not a reason to stop looking at it.
 *   3. The auto-merge kill switch may have been set on any ticket.
 *
 * That watch is small — the Loop Queue at 'needs your input' and 'ready to
 * launch' held one open ticket on the day this was written, against Agent
 * Response's 104. The saving comes from the big notify-only list, and the
 * correctness comes from not touching the small merge-capable one.
