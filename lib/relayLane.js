/**
 * relayLane — the pure decisions of Spirality's relay pass that are NOT
 * already in mergeOnComment.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-10-13, task 86bchpkxz). Dane wrote "merge PR #4" on
 * a Ready to launch ticket at 9:23 AM and nothing read it for four hours:
 * Spirality ran only loop-build and loop-review, and neither one merges.
 * `mergeOnComment` already decides WHETHER his word authorizes a merge
 * (mergeDecision) and whether GitHub will allow it (githubGate). What was
 * missing is the hands: a pass that reads the queue, carries those decisions
 * out, and writes the record back. That pass is the `relay` command in
 * scripts/clickup.mjs; the parts of it that can be decided without a network
 * live here, so each is tested without ClickUp or GitHub.
 *
 * Four small questions:
 *
 *   1. What do the threaded replies under one of his comments say about an
 *      earlier pass's answer?            → markerBookkeeping
 *   2. After the merge, Live or Queued?  → mergeDestination
 *   3. What does `gh pr view` need to be asked for, so githubGate can read
 *      every field it looks at?          → PR_VIEW_FIELDS
 *   4. His reply on a `Needs your input` ticket: move it, and where?
 *                                        → handbackAnswer, handbackPlan
 *   5. A PR his word cannot merge because it conflicts: file a catch-up
 *      ticket, or is one already on file? → conflictFilingPlan
 *   6. His close word on a `Ready to launch` ticket: is its work merged,
 *      so it goes to Live, or does the relay say why not? → closePlan
 *
 * Nothing here merges, posts, or reads a config. Every product-specific value
 * (the operator's id, the merge phrases, the repository) reaches the relay
 * through the project config at the door, never through this file.

/**
 * THE HAND-BACK: where an answered `Needs your input` ticket goes
 * (task 86bchpkxz, slice 2).
 *
 * The rules are busRelayPlan's, unchanged: the newest machine-written
 * question card is the question, his newest comment after it is the answer,
 * a hold-by-hand marker newer than the card withholds the move, an answer
 * already carrying the `[bus-relay-handback-done]` reply is spent, and
 * `handbackDestination` reads the answer ("close it") and then the ticket's
 * PR to pick `Queued`, `Rework` or `Live`. Two questions, because the second
 * needs a read the first decides whether to spend:
 *
 *   handbackAnswer(...)  which of his comments, if any, answers the card?
 *   handbackPlan(...)    given that answer's reply thread and the PR's
 *                        state, what does this pass do?
 *
 * WHERE THIS DIFFERS FROM STARCASTER, on purpose. StarCaster's bus-relay
 * relays his words to a party line and moves the ticket only on an answer
 * that was DELIVERED there (or receipted). Spirality has no party line: the
 * ticket is the only place his answer goes, and the loops read it there, so
 * an answer on the ticket is delivered by being written. The other half of
 * StarCaster's rule does not carry over: on a ticket with NO card it moves on
 * any comment relayed for the first time, and "first time" is a relay marker
 * Spirality never writes. Without it an old comment and a new one look the
 * same, so a ticket with no card is reported and left where it is — the
 * narrow mistake (a session moves it by hand) instead of the generous one
 * (a loop takes a ticket out of his status on something he said last week).
 * Spirality's `ask` always writes a card, so this is the hand-parked case.

 * it unstuck merged, and its card could only tell Dane to move it to Live

 *
 * One rule more, because Ready to launch is a status that waits on a merge:
 * the ticket goes to Live only when its work IS merged. That is its own PR,
 * or, with none of its own, the PR it was filed to unstick (the `- PR:` line
 * of a catch-up ticket's description). Anything else is said once, as a

/**
 * THE CONFLICT HAND-OFF: file a catch-up ticket, or is one already on file?

 *
 * Dane wrote "merge" on PR #12 and PR #13 on 2026-10-27; both conflicted with
 * `main`, and the relay posted a hand-off saying filing the resolution "did
 * not succeed" — when no filing had been attempted at all. Nothing picked
 * either up. The contract says a conflict files a `Queued` ticket for the
 * build loop; this is the decision half of that, conflictWork's rules
 * unchanged.
 *
 * The relay runs every ten minutes and a conflict can last a day, so the one
 * thing this must never do is file twice for one PR. Two places can show a
 * filing, read in this order:
 *
 *   1. the `CONFLICT TICKET FILED: PR #<n>` trail on the waiting ticket
 *      (findConflictTicket) — the record the relay writes after filing;
 *   2. an open ticket in the queue with exactly the name a filing would use —
 *      the case where the ticket was created but the trail comment did not
 *      post, so the next pass records it instead of filing a second one.
 *
 * @param comments    the waiting ticket's comments
 * @param prNumber    the conflicting PR
 * @param queueTasks  the open tickets in the Loop Queue (the pass's list read)
 * @param ticketName  conflictTicketName(...) for this PR
 * @param localVerdict the local conflict check, or null when none ran
 * @returns { act: 'none' | 'already-filed' | 'file', filed, recorded }
 *          `filed` is { id, url } when one is on file; `recorded` says
 *          whether the trail comment already names it.
