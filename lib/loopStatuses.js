/**
 * The Loop Queue's statuses, and the order loop-build drains them.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-31, task 86bbr1u9v). Until today a ticket sent back
 * by review returned to `Queued`, where it was INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM WORK
 * THAT WAS NEVER STARTED. Three things followed, all of them measured:
 *
 *   1. It was invisible. "52 queued, 1 in review" read as 52 fresh tickets;
 *      six of them were half-built with open pull requests. Finding that out
 *      took a morning of reading logs by hand.
 *   2. It lost its place in line. A sent-back ticket re-entered the priority
 *      contest from scratch, so normal-priority rework never won against fresh
 *      high-priority work. #419 (Aug 25), #446, #447 and #449 did not go stale
 *      by accident — THE CLAIM RULE DID IT TO THEM.
 *   3. The cap could not report honestly. `wip-check` said "1 in flight, cap
 *      5" while five real branches sat open, because `Queued` is deliberately
 *      not counted — and it must not be, or the cap blocks the only work that
 *      could clear it (the 2026-08-25 deadlock, task 86bbm4zwd).
 *
 * So a send-back now lands in its own status, `Rework`, and this module is the
 * ONE place that says so. The name is Dane's call, 2026-08-31: "Recycle" was
 * rejected because recycling loses the thing's form, and here the branch, the
 * PR, the commits and the review notes all survive intact; "Send-back" was
 * rejected because it names the transition, and every other status on this
 * list names a state.
 *
 * WHY ONE MODULE AND NOT A STRING IN EACH CALLER. The status is read by the
 * claim gate, the pacing curve, the WIP cap, the pause sweep, the pulse and
 * the weekly report. `wipCap.ticketIdFromPrBody` already carries a comment
 * about the cost of two functions disagreeing about the same string; six would
 * be worse. A status list that drifts fails the way this ticket's own bug
 * failed — silently, and in the direction of looking fine.

// ── The taxonomy: every SET of these seven is defined here, and only here ────
//
// (2026-09-02, task 86bbtujed — audit Phase 2.) Until today wipCap,
// pipelinePause and pulse each kept a private, partial copy of these
// groupings. When Rework was added on 2026-08-31 it had to be threaded
// through each file by hand, and wipCap and pulse had already drifted into
// DISAGREEING about what "done" means — four names versus one, both
// load-bearing. A set defined below is imported by its consumers as a view;
// the reasons a consumer cares about a particular view stay as comments ON
// that view, where they belong.

/**
 * Work that genuinely occupies the pipeline: a pull request whose ticket
 * wears one of these is real in-flight work — the merge side's question.
 * pipelinePause asks a NARROWER one (is a PASS actually running?) and derives
 * its pair of machine statuses from these minus OPERATOR_HELD, with its
 * reasoning kept on that view.
 *
 * THIS IS STILL THE HONEST TOTAL, and pulse and the throughput report both
 * want exactly it. What changed on 2026-09-04 (task 86bbuzzbk) is that
 * `wipCap` no longer measures its cap against this whole set — see
 * IN_PROGRESS_STATUSES below for the split and the reason.

/**
 * In-flight work that a MACHINE is still moving — in-flight minus the two
 * statuses parked on Dane. Derived, never re-listed, so the relationship is
 * what breaks if someone edits either side.
 *
 * WHY THE SPLIT EXISTS (2026-09-04, task 86bbuzzbk). `wipCap` used to measure
 * its cap of five against the whole IN_FLIGHT set, so a ticket that was
 * finished, reviewed, green and waiting only for Dane to press merge held one
 * of the five build slots for as long as he was asleep. Fill all five and the
 * build loop stops completely, however deep the queue is.
 *
 * The effect ran backwards: THE LONGER DANE WAS AWAY, THE LESS THE MACHINES
 * WERE ALLOWED TO DO. On the night of 2026-09-03 the cap sat full for three
 * separate hours with 66-71 tickets claimable, and loop-build ran roughly 222
 * of 640 minutes. It also put a hard ceiling of five on how much finished work
 * could ever be waiting for him at once — which is the thing he actually
 * asked for more of.
 *
 * WHAT THE OLD READING GOT RIGHT, AND WHY IT IS NOT LOST. The argument on
 * IN_FLIGHT_STATUSES ran: a ticket parked on Dane with an open PR is real work
 * occupying the merge pipeline, its branch still needs catching up every time
 * something lands, and "if his inbox is full the pipeline genuinely is full" —
 * so a cap that hid that would lie in the more dangerous direction. Every word
 * of that is still true, and none of it is being discarded.
 *
 * The mistake was answering it with ONE number. "Is the merge pipeline full?"
 * and "should loop-build stop producing?" are different questions, and
 * collapsing them made an honest signal into a throttle on the wrong thing.
 * So there are now two limits, not none: this set carries the build cap, and
 * OPERATOR_HELD carries its own separate ceiling in wipCap. Operator-held work
 * still bounds the loop — at its own, larger number — and `wip-check` names
 * all three counts every time. The reporting gets MORE precise, not quieter,
 * which is the direction the original argument was protecting.
